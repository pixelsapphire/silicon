Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. Definitions

This "License" refers to version 1 of the Silicon License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface
provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library
is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the
Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the
"Linked Version".

1. Conveying Modified Versions

Modified versions of The Library may be distributed under the
same License, provided that they are plainly marked as such,
mentioning the original name and author of The Library.

2. Combined Works

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice, if
you also do both of the following:

 a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work
    that The Library is used in it and that The Library and its
    use are covered by this License.
 b) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library
    among these notices.

3. Combined Libraries

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other
library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered
by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms
of your choice, if you also do the following:

 a) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of
    it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
    find the uncombined form of the same work.
